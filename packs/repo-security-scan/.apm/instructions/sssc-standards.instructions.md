# SSSC Phase 3: Standards Mapping

Map the assessed supply chain posture against OpenSSF® standards. Use the Phase 2 assessment results as input.

## OpenSSF Scorecard: 20 Checks

Map each Scorecard check to the repository's current implementation and identify the available workflow or script from hve-core or physical-ai-toolchain.

| #  | Check                  | Risk     | Score Range    | Agent Mapping                                                                   |

For each check, record:

* **Current score** (estimated 0–10 or binary 0/10)
* **Evidence** (file paths, workflow names, configuration details)
* **Available implementation** (which hve-core or PAT workflow/script addresses this check)
* **Gap** (what is missing to achieve maximum score)

## SLSA Build Track Levels

Assess the repository against SLSA Build track requirements:

| Level    | Requirements                                      | Assessment Criteria                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Build L0 | No requirements                                   | Baseline, all repositories start here                       |
| Build L1 | Provenance exists and is distributed to consumers | Check for `actions/attest-build-provenance` or equivalent   |
| Build L2 | Hosted build platform, signed provenance          | Verify GitHub Actions (hosted), Sigstore provenance signing |
| Build L3 | Build runs in isolation, signing key isolation    | Verify ephemeral runners, ephemeral Sigstore keys (OIDC)    |

Record current level and specific steps needed to reach the next level.

## Best Practices Badge Criteria

Assess readiness against OpenSSF Best Practices Badge tiers:

| Level   | Focus                       | Key Criteria                                                                      |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Passing | Basic hygiene (67 criteria) | LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, build system, test suite, security policy, static analysis |
| Silver  | Governance + quality        | GOVERNANCE.md, code coverage, reproducible builds, signed releases                |
| Gold    | Advanced security           | Formal verification, security audits, advanced threat modeling                    |

Map repository files and practices to Badge criteria. Flag missing criteria as gaps.

## Sigstore Standards

Assess Sigstore adoption maturity:

* **Not adopted**: No signing or attestation in place
* **Basic**: Build provenance via `actions/attest-build-provenance`
* **Intermediate**: Build provenance + SBOM attestation via `actions/attest`
* **Advanced**: Tag signing via gitsign + build provenance + SBOM attestation + verification workflow

Document current level and steps to advance.

## SBOM Standards

Assess SBOM generation and distribution:

* **Format**: SPDX-JSON (preferred for GitHub ecosystem) or CycloneDX
* **Generator**: anchore/sbom-action with syft, or Microsoft SBOM Tool
* **Distribution**: Attached to release artifacts, published to dependency graph
* **NTIA minimum elements**: Supplier, component name, version, unique identifier, dependency relationship, author, timestamp

Verify NTIA minimum element compliance for existing SBOM output.

## Researcher Subagent Delegation

Supply chain security standards evolve rapidly and contain framework-specific guidance best retrieved on demand. The following standards are delegated to the Researcher Subagent at runtime:

| Standard                        | Rationale for Delegation                                                      |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenSSF Scorecard check details | Check-specific scoring criteria and remediation evolve with each release      |
| SLSA Build Track specification  | Version-dependent build integrity requirements and verification procedures    |
| Sigstore signing models         | Keyless signing setup varies by package manager and CI platform               |
| SBOM format specifications      | SPDX and CycloneDX schemas evolve; NTIA minimum element guidance updates      |
| Best Practices Badge criteria   | Tier-specific criteria and evidence requirements change across badge versions |
| WAF / CAF                       | Cloud-specific supply chain security guidance, frequently updated             |

Do NOT delegate OpenSSF Scorecard check names, SLSA level definitions, Sigstore maturity levels, SBOM standard names, or Best Practices Badge tier names. Those are embedded above.

### When to Delegate

* Phase 3 identifies supply chain controls that exceed embedded standards coverage.
* Scorecard check remediation requires platform-specific or version-specific guidance.
* SLSA level verification requires CI-platform-specific build provenance procedures.
* Sigstore adoption requires package-manager-specific signing configuration.
* SBOM generation requires tool-specific or language-specific format guidance.
* Compliance requirements demand WAF or CAF supply chain pillar mapping.

### Invocation Pattern

Use `runSubagent` or `task` with the Researcher Subagent:

```text
Agent: Researcher Subagent
Topic: {specific supply chain standard area to research}
Context: Repository "{name}" with supply chain maturity "{current-level}" targeting "{target-level}"
Output: .copilot-tracking/research/subagents/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/{repo-name}-{standard}.md
```

The Researcher Subagent returns: subagent research document path, research status, important discovered details, recommended next research not yet completed, and any clarifying questions.

When neither `runSubagent` nor `task` tools are available, inform the user that one of these tools is required and should be enabled. Do not synthesize or fabricate answers for delegated standards from training data.

Execution constraints: Complete research within a single invocation. Do not delegate to additional subagents.

### Query Templates

* OpenSSF Scorecard: "OpenSSF Scorecard {check-name} check scoring criteria and remediation steps for {CI-platform}"
* SLSA: "SLSA Build Track Level {N} requirements and verification for {CI-platform} with {build-system}"
* Sigstore: "Sigstore keyless signing setup for {package-manager} with {CI-platform}"
* SBOM: "{SPDX-JSON|CycloneDX} SBOM generation with {tool} for {language} project covering NTIA minimum elements"
* Best Practices Badge: "OpenSSF Best Practices Badge {tier} criteria for {project-type} projects"
* WAF/CAF: "Microsoft Well-Architected Framework supply chain security pillar for {technology-stack} on {cloud-platform}"

Subagents can run in parallel when researching independent standard domains.
