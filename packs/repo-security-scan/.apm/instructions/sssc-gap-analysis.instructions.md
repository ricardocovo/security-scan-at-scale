# SSSC Phase 4 — Gap Analysis

Compare the repository's current supply chain security posture against the desired state using Phase 3 standards mapping output.

## Gap Table Format

Produce a prioritized gap table sorted by Scorecard risk level (Critical > High > Medium > Low):

| Gap           | Scorecard Check | Risk                       | Current State | Target State | Adoption Type | Effort     | Workflow/Script Reference |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|------------|---------------------------|
| {description} | {check_name}    | {Critical/High/Medium/Low} | {current}     | {target}     | {category}    | {S/M/L/XL} | {reference}               |

Include all 20 Scorecard checks and any additional SLSA, Badge, Sigstore, or SBOM gaps not directly mapped to a Scorecard check.

## Six Adoption Categories

Classify each gap into one of six adoption categories based on the required implementation effort:

### 1. Reusable Workflow Adoption

Reference an hve-core workflow directly via `uses:` in the target repository. Lowest effort — the target repo adds a workflow file that calls the reusable workflow.

Applicable checks: CI-Tests (#3), SAST (#14), Vulnerabilities (#19), and other checks where hve-core provides a reusable `workflow_call` workflow.

### 2. Workflow Copy/Modify

Copy a workflow from physical-ai-toolchain (or hve-core) and adapt it to the target repository's technology stack. Medium effort — requires editing workflow configuration.

Applicable checks: Dependency-Update-Tool (#8), SBOM (#15), Signed-Releases (#17), and other checks requiring repository-specific tuning.

### 3. Reusable Workflow + Script Adoption

Adopt both a reusable workflow and its supporting PowerShell or Python scripts. Medium effort — requires both workflow reference and script installation.

Applicable checks: Pinned-Dependencies (#13), Token-Permissions (#18), and other checks with validation scripts.

### 4. Platform Configuration

GitHub or Azure DevOps settings configured via the web UI or API. Variable effort — depends on organizational policies and admin access.

Applicable checks: Binary-Artifacts (#1), Branch-Protection (#2), Code-Review (#5), CII-Best-Practices (#4), License (#10), Security-Policy (#16), Webhooks (#20).

### 5. New Capability

Requires building something not available in either hve-core or physical-ai-toolchain. Highest effort.

Applicable checks: Fuzzing (#9) — requires setting up ClusterFuzzLite, OSS-Fuzz, or a custom fuzzing harness.

### 6. N/A / Organic

Not actionable as backlog items. These checks improve through natural project activity.

Applicable checks: Contributors (#6), Maintained (#11), Packaging (#12).

## Effort Sizing

Assign T-shirt sizes based on implementation scope:

| Size | Criteria                                           | Typical Duration |
|------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| S    | Single file addition or configuration change       | < 1 day          |
| M    | Multiple files or workflow customization required  | 1–3 days         |
| L    | Cross-cutting changes across CI/CD pipeline        | 3–5 days         |
| XL   | New capability build or major architectural change | 1+ weeks         |

## Full 20-Check Reference Mapping

Use this reference table when mapping gaps. It provides the known implementation sources for each Scorecard check:

Adjust adoption type and effort based on the target repository's actual technology stack and existing tooling.

## Gap Prioritization

Within the gap table, sort entries by:

1. Scorecard risk level: Critical > High > Medium > Low
2. Within the same risk level: checks with available reusable workflows before those requiring new capabilities
3. Within the same adoption type: lower effort before higher effort

## Output

Write the analysis to `.copilot-tracking/sssc-plans/{project-slug}/gap-analysis.md`.

Structure the output as:

```markdown
# Gap Analysis — {project-slug}

## Summary
- Total gaps: {count}
- Critical: {count} | High: {count} | Medium: {count} | Low: {count}
- Reusable workflow adoption: {count}
- Workflow copy/modify: {count}
- Workflow + script: {count}
- Platform config: {count}
- New capability: {count}

Update `state.json`:
* Set `phases.4-gap-analysis.status` to `✅`
